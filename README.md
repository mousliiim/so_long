# Project for 42 Paris - So_Long

In this project, we must implement our own 2D game, using the miniLibX library.
The rules of the game are as followed:

Maps must be stored in files, and the extension must be ".ber".

Maps must be composed of only 9 possible characters :

0 for an empty space

1 for a wall

P for the player's starting position

C for a collectible item

E for an exit

n for a north-facing enemy

w for a west-facing enemy

s for a south-facing enemy

e for an east-facing enemy



The map must be closed/surrounded by walls.
The player must collect all the collectible items, then go to the exit to win the game.
The player can move using the W, A, S and D keys, or the arrow keys.
The player can quit the game by pressing the ESC key, or by clicking the top-right cross.
If the player touches an enemy, the game is over.
The game must display the number of moves the player has made.
